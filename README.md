# Confetti 🎉

<!-- Captura de la app -->
<!-- Create your account now! ➜ (link) -->

## 👀 What is this?

This is a mobile-first approach app. When it is finished, you will be able to create your own account and add the birthdays of your family and friends, so you don't forget any of them again!

The app will have a calendar view and a detail view so you can edit the data of each birthday and add notes. There will also be a birthday reminder service from the backend. Enjoy it! 🥳

## 📅 What am I working on now

- [x] Create *react.js* project structure :)
- [ ] Logo, icons, fonts, palette
- [x] Integrate styled-components
- [ ] Header that hides on scroll down
- [ ] Button component (I recreated the material design ripple effect with some help from [this post](https://dev.to/rohanfaiyazkhan/recreating-the-material-design-ripple-effect-in-react-54p))
- [ ] Dropdown component
- [ ] Uso de memo
- [ ] Integrate Redux or React Context API
- [ ] Routes: login/register and app (react-router-dom)
- [ ] Login and register services
- [ ] Calendar
- [ ] Modal component
...
- [ ] Review prop-types and defaultProps
- [ ] Tests

- [ ] Create *react native* project structure!

## 🤝 Partnership

The backend of this app is being provided by my partner [Marrarichy Da Silva](https://github.com/scatt89).
We have planned together the API contract and the features of the app.

## 💪 Challenges

This is the first time for me that I create an app with the whole **authentication process**, including register, login, forget password, different routes and services to change birthday data in calendar, account settings, delete account, etc.

Just as my app is going to have many features, I am also planning a complete frontend development, including **tests**. It will be my first time integrating tests in a large development.

Also I am doing this work in collaboration with my partner Marrarichy, which requieres of precise **teamwork**.

## 💡 To Do

...
<!-- Tests -->
<!-- React native or WPA :) -->

## 🔧 Production build

To generate a production ready version on `docs` folder:

1. Add `"homepage": "./"` in `package.json`
2. Make sure there are only `https` in your project (replace all references to http with https)
3. `$ npm run build` + `$ mv build docs`

Now you can upload your public folder to GitHub Pages or similar :)
